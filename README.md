- Data source: Twitter data

4. Samples_Round_2 - sample data, round 2

### Naming convention of sample data

1. Say that created a stream of tweets for a group called "media". You gave your stream the name of 'streamed_tweets_media'. As a result, the stream file name would be:
	- 'streamed_tweets_media.json'
2. Then, you cleaned this stream using the TSA program in the next section. The newly created file would have an "clean" appended to it. New file:
	- 'streamed_tweets_media_clean.csv'
3. Next, you fetch non-filtered tweets for this stream. Three files are created:
	- 'streamed_tweets_clean_full.json' (this is the full data in json format)
	- 'streamed_tweets_clean_full_trunc.csv' (same data but limited columns for readability's sake)
	- 'streamed_tweets_clean_full_trunc.json' (same as the csv above but in json format)
4. Finally, create the sentiment analysis for the tweets. Output file:
	- 'streamed_tweets_media_clean_full_analysis.csv' (import this into R.)
