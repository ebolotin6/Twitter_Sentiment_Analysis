### Link to program -

[Twitter Sentiment Analyzer](https://github.com/ebolotin6/Twitter_Sentiment_Analyzer/ "Twitter Sentiment Analyzer") - This project is created with this program.

### Naming convention of sample data -

1. Say that you created a stream of tweets for a group called "media". You gave your stream the name of '*streamed_tweets_media*'. As a result, the stream file name would be:
	- '*streamed_tweets_media.**json***'

2. Then, clean this stream using the TSA program in the next section. The newly created file would have an "clean" appended to it. New file:
	- '*streamed_tweets_media_clean.**csv***'

3. Next, fetch non-filtered tweets for this stream. Three files are created:
	- '*streamed_tweets_clean_full.**json***' (this is the full data in json format)
	- '*streamed_tweets_clean_full_trunc.**csv***' (same data but limited columns for readability's sake)
	- '*streamed_tweets_clean_full_trunc.**json***' (same as the csv above but in json format)

4. Finally, create the sentiment analysis for the tweets. Output file:
	- '*streamed_tweets_media_clean_full_analysis.**csv***' (import this into R.)
